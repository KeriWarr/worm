A multiplayer TRON-like competetive action game I wrote in Turing during highschool.

This was a fun learning experience for me, however due to the fact that Turing is really only useful as an educational language, I have no plans to suport this project or do any further work on it. It was fun while it lasted.

NOTE: In it's current state, due to the fact that the external image and music resources are missing, the game will not run in a Turing Environment; it is only hosted here for the benefit of having the code I wrote visible publicly.
